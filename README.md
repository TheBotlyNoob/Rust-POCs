# Rust UAC Bypass Proof Of Concept

A proof of concept for a UAC bypass using Rust by mocking trusted directories.
See https://medium.com/tenable-techblog/uac-bypass-by-mocking-trusted-directories-24a96675f6e for more information on how the bypass works.

To get started, just install Rust, and execute `cargo run`. To edit the dll, just go to [dll/src/lib.rs](./dll/src/lib.rs)
